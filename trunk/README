Instructions how to compile and use C++ RTMP Server (a.k.a crtmpserver)

Requirements:
* GCC and other C++ tools
* SVN
* libdl, libssl, libcrypto
(make sure you have the "devel" packages of libdl, ssl and crypto installed prior to compiling)

In order to get the source code, issue the following command:

svn co --username anonymous https://svn.rtmpd.com/crtmpserver/trunk crtmpserver
When it asks for password, hit Enter key

Compile the package. Do the following steps:

cd crtmpserver/builders/cmake
cmake .

(this step will create all the Makefile's that are required. If some package is missing, the cmake will complain)

make

The compilation procedure should be finished within few minutes.

After you compiled the package, it's time to test it. Run the following command:

./rtmpserver/rtmpserver rtmpserver/rtmpserver.lua

If everything goes well, you'll get on your console a table with IP's, ports, protocols, and application names
If you see this table, then crtmpserver  is working.

Lets test it the server. Follow these simple steps:

* Download a simple FLV or MP4 file. You can dowload a sample file from here: http://www.mediacollege.com/adobe/flash/video/tutorial/example-flv.html
* Place the file you downloaded into the crtmpserver/media folder
* Download an FLV player. For this example, we'll use JW Player. Get it here: http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player
* Extract the JW Player to a directory which is accessible through your web server
* Go to the extracted directory and create an HTML file which will include the player and play the file. Here's an example:

<html>
<body>
<script type='text/javascript' src='swfobject.js'></script>

<div id='mediaspace'>This text will be replaced</div>

<script type='text/javascript'>
  var so = new SWFObject('player.swf','mpl','640','360','9');
  so.addParam('allowfullscreen','true');
  so.addParam('allowscriptaccess','always');
  so.addParam('wmode','opaque');
  so.addVariable('file','file-download');
  so.addVariable('streamer','rtmp://127.0.0.1/flvplayback/');
  so.write('mediaspace');
</script>
</body>
</html>

* Change the 127.0.0.1 to either the IP of your crtmpserver or simply use a hostname of your machine
* Replace file-download with the actual filename of your sample you download. Remeber to omit the .flv if it's an FLV file
* Open a web browser and point it to to the web server IP/Hostname and the directory you installed the player
(example: http://127.0.0.1/player)
* You should see a player. Click the play button and the video should be played.

If you see the video, then everything works well.

Installing crtmpserver:

* Go to the directory crtmpserver/cmake/packing/
* Run the following command: ./linux.sh
* You will find in /tmp a directory called: rtmpserver
* Move the rtmpserver to whatever location you want (/opt or /usr/local for example)
* After you moved the directory, cd into it and do: ./run.sh   (this will start the crtmpserver)

crtmpserver settings
* All crtmpserver settings are located in a detailed file calle: rtmpserver.lua
